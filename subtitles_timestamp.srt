1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,832
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML, DL and

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:07,592
ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today. Stay tuned.

3
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:11,064
So let's dive right into it. So AI vs ML vs

4
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,856
DL vs DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify

5
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:18,280
all of that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,752
AI. So AI is really to do

7
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:25,192
with the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks

8
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:29,074
without explicitly programming them, otherwise known as the ability

9
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:32,226
for computers and machines to think by themselves.

10
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,322
So we typically break out AI into two key categories. These are

11
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:39,954
general AI and narrow AI. General AI typically

12
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:43,426
refers to the ability for a computer or a machine to be able to handle

13
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,802
a wide variety of tasks. Us as humans have

14
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:50,082
the ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can see, we can speak,

15
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:53,426
we can hear, we can read, we can drive, we can do a whole range

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:57,272
of things. The ability for AI and machines to be able to do a

17
00:00:57,296 --> 00:01:00,744
broad range of tasks similar to humans is what we typically refer

18
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:04,312
to as general AI. Now, we're still a little bit of

19
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:08,040
a while away from true general AI, but that's not to say it's not to

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,072
come. Now, narrow AI, on the other hand, is the ability for a

21
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:15,432
machine to handle a really simple or a really narrow range of

22
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:19,176
tasks. So that could possibly be the ability to translate speech to text,

23
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,920
or to classify images as having different categories, or the ability

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,172
to predict house prices, for example. All of these are examples of narrow

25
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:30,660
AI. So I'm going to be painting a bunch of visual imagery to help

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,100
you remember some of these topics. So the first one, in terms of breaking out

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,004
general and narrow AI, or the ability to remember general and narrow AI,

28
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:41,812
is just picture a really narrow or really skinny general in your mind.

29
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:45,492
So that way you know that there's two different types of AI, general and

30
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:49,204
narrow. Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI

31
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:52,692
as being broken up into general and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into

32
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:56,664
this? Well, machine learning is the application of narrow AI

33
00:01:56,712 --> 00:02:00,296
to specific tasks. Now, when we typically talk about machine learning,

34
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,816
we often compare it to traditional programming. So in traditional programming,

35
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:08,056
we supply data plus rules or conditional logic, and we get answers.

36
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:11,624
Now, in machine learning, on the other hand, we provide data plus

37
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:15,272
historical answers to get rules. We can then pass new data to

38
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:18,632
get new answers. So this is a bit of a change in the paradigm of

39
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:22,216
how computer scientists and machine learning engineers are building programs

40
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:25,728
these days. So what are some typical machine learning tasks?

41
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:29,648
Well, we broadly break out machine learning into three key

42
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:33,184
categories. These are supervised learning, unsupervised learning,

43
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:36,272
and semi supervised learning. So let's take a look at supervised learning

44
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:39,808
first. So supervised learning can be broadly broken out into two

45
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:43,232
key categories. These are classification and regression.

46
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:47,264
Classification is all to do with grouping things into categories

47
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:50,816
or labels. So say you had a big data set on all the different types

48
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:54,240
of pizzas you've liked and whether or not you've liked them, yes or no,

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,180
you, you could take that data and pass it through to a classification algorithm

50
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,380
to help it learn which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass

51
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,932
through a new list of ingredients, it would be able to predict yes, you would

52
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:08,164
like that pizza, or no, you might not. Regression, on the

53
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:12,196
other hand, is all to do with predicting continuous variables. Some great examples

54
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:15,460
of regression are sales forecasting and predicting prices of

55
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,076
houses. So that encapsulates supervised learning. Now what about unsupervised

56
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:22,910
learning? Well, there's two key things to think about when you think of

57
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,590
unsupervised learning. These are really clustering. So the ability to

58
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,934
group people together. So say you wanted to group together high performing

59
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:33,390
and low performing and medium performing employees or high

60
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,990
value, low value, medium value customers, or a whole bunch of other different

61
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,334
types of data. But really it's all to do with grouping things together.

62
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:44,862
Now dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, is all to do with condensing

63
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:48,162
the features that you've got within a machine learning model. So, so a lot

64
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,202
of the time you might start out with a huge data set with a lot

65
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:54,674
of columns and you're not really sure which of those columns are important for your

66
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:58,482
machine learning model. Dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number

67
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:02,802
of columns that you've got so that you can really focus on the important ones.

68
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:06,962
Now in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised learning,

69
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:11,298
I'd suggest you remember this initialism Christopher Robin, Quarter duck.

70
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:15,810
So that way you remember classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality

71
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,205
reduction. So, so that takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning.

72
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:23,013
But what about semi supervised learning? Well, this is where reinforcement

73
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:26,629
learning comes in. Now reinforcement learning has four key things.

74
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:30,773
These are an agent, an action, an environment, and a reward.

75
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,485
It's similar to how you might choose to condition a dog. A dog

76
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:38,181
might do something, right and you might reward it with a piece of food.

77
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:41,957
In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models to act

78
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:46,292
in a correct way in a given environment in, in order to learn appropriate actions

79
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:50,564
given that specific environment. Now the best way to Remember reinforcement learning

80
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:54,500
techniques is to remember Area 51. So that way you remember

81
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,340
agent, reward, environment and actions. Okay, so that takes care

82
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,620
of machine learning. Now we're going to delve a little bit deeper and get into

83
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,252
deep learning. So deep learning is a subset of machine learning

84
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:08,548
and really it's to do with performing machine learning tasks

85
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:12,278
using deep neural networks. Now, deep neural networks

86
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:15,590
and networks that have multiple hidden layers. So if you've ever

87
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,558
seen a diagram that looks sort of like this, this is a representation

88
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:23,462
of a neural network. But specifically in this case, this is a

89
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:26,822
deep neural network because it has multiple hidden layers.

90
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:30,342
Now the best way to remember deep learning is to remember that deep learning

91
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:33,462
is just like an onion, it has multiple layers. Little bit

92
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:37,382
like Shrek. Now that sort of covers AI, ML and DL.

93
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:41,290
What, what about data science? Well, data science is the practice that

94
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,210
sits over AI, ML and DL. It basically is

95
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,890
the art of extracting knowledge, insight and meaning from

96
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,538
data. The best way to remember the key components of data science are to look

97
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:56,538
at the CRISP DM framework. So the CRISP DM framework stands

98
00:05:56,554 --> 00:06:00,154
for the cross industry standard process for data mining. And basically

99
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:03,530
it's a framework to help you along your way to producing really

100
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,208
good data science projects. Now, there's six key steps in

101
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:11,256
the data science process. These are business understanding, so understanding

102
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,776
the business that you're working with and the environment in which they operate.

103
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:18,616
Two data understanding, so understanding the data that you've got

104
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:22,120
on hand so whether or not you've got missing values, visualizing that

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,560
data and taking a look at some summary statistics. We've then got

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,688
data preparation. So this is all to do with getting our data ready for modeling.

107
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:33,256
In this step we might perform some feature engineering and create some new columns.

108
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:36,936
We might fill in some missing values and, and a whole bunch of other data

109
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:40,712
preparation steps, like for example, splitting our data into training and

110
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:43,864
testing. Next we've got my favorite, which is modeling.

111
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:47,240
This is all to do with training your machine learning algorithms to

112
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,936
perform well on a specific task. Once we've trained our models

113
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:54,856
in that modeling step, we get onto evaluation. Given that we've trained

114
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:57,672
our model, we want to make sure that it's going to work well once we

115
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:01,000
deploy it into the real world. This is what the evaluation step

116
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,162
is all about it. In this step, we try to check whether or not our

117
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:07,970
model is likely to perform well using specific evaluation metrics.

118
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,282
Now once we've gone through all of that, the last step is to go and

119
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,594
deploy our model. In order to deploy our model, we could release it as

120
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:18,402
a REST API, containerize it up, or save it as a binary so

121
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:22,226
we can go and use it elsewhere. Now a great way to remember Crisp

122
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:26,002
DM is to remember Barry drove directly to the Medical Emergency

123
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,842
department. That way you remember business Understanding data understanding

124
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:33,300
data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

125
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,800
Now I've talked a lot about theory, but where do the Python packages that you

126
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,432
typically see used fit into this framework? Well, in terms

127
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:44,624
of data science, Numpy, Pandas, and matplotlib are probably going to be the most important

128
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:48,032
packages that you see floating around. Numpy and Pandas

129
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:51,312
help you traverse and explore your data and really work with

130
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:55,184
your data in terms of performing manipulations and data preparation.

131
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:58,608
Matplotlib and Seaborn help you visualize that data and

132
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:02,594
explore it even further. Now, the most important library in terms of machine learning

133
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:06,242
is probably scikit Learn. So scikit Learn has been around for quite some time

134
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:10,226
and gives you a whole bunch of really powerful algorithms

135
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:14,018
and utilities to help use them to train your machine learning models.

136
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:18,082
Now deep learning is becoming increasingly popular and there's a large number of

137
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:21,362
libraries that can help you perform deep learning. Some of

138
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:24,754
which which are notable are TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch,

139
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:29,094
and Theano, just to name a few. And that about wraps up AI vs

140
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,486
ML vs DL vs DS. Thanks so much for tuning

141
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:35,894
in guys. Hopefully you found this video useful. If you did, be sure to give

142
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:38,694
it a thumbs up and hit subscribe. Until next time.

1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,160
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,856
DL and ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today.

3
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:11,064
Stay tuned. So let's dive right into it. So AI vs ML vs

4
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:15,240
DL vs DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify all

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,100
of that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at AI.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,528
So AI is really to do with the ability of computers and

7
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:27,176
machines to perform tasks without explicitly programming

00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,802
them, otherwise known as the ability for computers and machines to

9
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:34,418
think by themselves. So we typically break out AI into

10
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:38,578
two key categories. These are general AI and narrow AI.

11
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:41,986
General AI typically refers to the ability for a computer

12
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,570
or a machine to be able to handle a wide variety of tasks.

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,962
Us as humans have the ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can

14
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:52,194
see, we can speak, we can hear, we can read, we can drive,

15
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,832
we can do a whole range of things. The ability for AI and

16
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:59,592
machines to be able to do a broad range of tasks similar to humans is

17
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:03,608
what we typically refer to as general AI. Now, we're still

18
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,952
a little bit of a while away from true general AI, but that's not

19
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:10,552
to say it's not to come. Now, narrow AI, on the

20
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:14,152
other hand, is the ability for a machine to handle a really simple or

21
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:17,672
a really narrow range of tasks. So that could possibly be the ability to

22
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:21,368
translate speech to text, or to classify images as having different

23
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:24,972
categories, or the ability to predict house prices, for example.

24
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:28,692
All of these are examples of narrow AI. So I'm going to be

25
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:31,924
painting a bunch of visual imagery to help you remember some of these topics.

26
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:35,364
So the first one, in terms of breaking out general and narrow AI,

27
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:38,740
or the ability to remember general and narrow AI, is just

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,132
picture a really narrow or really skinny general in your mind. So that

29
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:46,020
way you know that there's two different types of AI, general and narrow.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,412
Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI as

31
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:53,200
being broken up into general and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into this?

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,920
Well, machine learning is the application of narrow AI to

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,296
specific tasks. Now, when we typically talk about machine learning,

34
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,816
we often compare it to traditional programming. So in traditional programming,

35
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:08,056
we supply data plus rules or conditional logic, and we get answers.

36
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:12,280
Now, in machine learning, on the other hand, we provide data plus historical

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,296
answers to get rules. We can then pass new data to get new answers.

38
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:19,736
So this is a bit of a change in the paradigm of how computer scientists

39
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:23,040
and machine learning engineers are building programs these days.

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,056
So what are some typical machine learning tasks? Well, we broadly

41
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:30,848
break out machine learning into three key categories. These are

42
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:34,544
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi supervised learning.

43
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:38,032
So let's take a look at supervised learning first. So supervised learning can

44
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:42,112
be broadly broken out into two key categories. These are classification

45
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:45,344
and regression. Classification is all to do with

46
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,752
grouping things into categories or labels. So say you had

47
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:52,320
a big data set on all the different types of pizzas you've liked and whether

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,540
or not you've liked them, yes or no, you, you could take that data

49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,172
and pass it through to a classification algorithm to help it learn

50
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:02,052
which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass through a new list

51
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:05,716
of ingredients, it would be able to predict yes, you would like that pizza,

52
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:09,332
or no, you might not. Regression, on the other hand, is all to do

53
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,932
with predicting continuous variables. Some great examples of regression

54
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:16,804
are sales forecasting and predicting prices of houses. So that encapsulates

55
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:20,138
supervised learning. Now what about unsupervised learning? Well,

56
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:23,694
there's two key things to think about when you think of unsupervised

57
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:27,118
learning. These are really clustering. So the ability to group people

58
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:31,070
together. So say you wanted to group together high performing and low performing and

59
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,286
medium performing employees or high value, low value,

60
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:37,854
medium value customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of data.

61
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:41,854
But really it's all to do with grouping things together. Now dimensionality reduction,

62
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,822
on the other hand, is all to do with condensing the features that

63
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:48,722
you've got within a machine learning model. So, so a lot of the time you

64
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:52,258
might start out with a huge data set with a lot of columns and you're

65
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,650
not really sure which of those columns are important for your machine learning model.

66
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,154
Dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number of columns

67
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:02,802
that you've got so that you can really focus on the important ones.

68
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:06,354
Now in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised

69
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:10,066
learning, I'd suggest you remember this initialism Christopher

70
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:13,266
Robin, Quarter duck. So that way you remember classification,

71
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,354
regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

72
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:20,645
So, so that takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning. But what about semi supervised

73
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,925
learning? Well, this is where reinforcement learning comes in.

74
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,397
Now reinforcement learning has four key things. These are

75
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:30,773
an agent, an action, an environment, and a reward.

76
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,709
It's similar to how you might choose to condition a dog. A dog might

77
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:38,181
do something, right and you might reward it with a piece of food.

78
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:42,181
In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models to act in

79
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:45,700
a correct way in a given environment in, in order to learn appropriate

80
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,412
actions given that specific environment. Now the best way to Remember

81
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:53,476
reinforcement learning techniques is to remember Area 51.

82
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:57,108
So that way you remember agent, reward, environment and actions.

83
00:04:57,204 --> 00:05:00,452
Okay, so that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going to delve a little

84
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:04,388
bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep learning is a subset

85
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,924
of machine learning and really it's to do with performing machine learning

86
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:11,270
tasks using deep neural networks. Now,

87
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,678
deep neural networks and networks that have multiple hidden layers.

88
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:17,990
So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of like this,

89
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,294
this is a representation of a neural network. But specifically

90
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:26,166
in this case, this is a deep neural network because it has multiple hidden

91
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:29,974
layers. Now the best way to remember deep learning is to remember that deep

92
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:33,670
learning is just like an onion, it has multiple layers. Little bit like

93
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,382
Shrek. Now that sort of covers AI, ML and DL.

94
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:41,034
What, what about data science? Well, data science is the practice

95
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:43,994
that sits over AI, ML and DL.

96
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:47,418
It basically is the art of extracting knowledge,

97
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,986
insight and meaning from data. The best way to remember the key components

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,634
of data science are to look at the CRISP DM framework.

99
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:58,698
So the CRISP DM framework stands for the cross industry standard process

100
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:02,490
for data mining. And basically it's a framework to help you along your way

101
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,512
to producing really good data science projects. Now,

102
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:09,288
there's six key steps in the data science process. These are

103
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:12,600
business understanding, so understanding the business that you're working with

104
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,600
and the environment in which they operate. Two data understanding,

105
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,312
so understanding the data that you've got on hand so whether or not you've got

106
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,784
missing values, visualizing that data and taking a look at some summary

107
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:27,192
statistics. We've then got data preparation. So this is all

108
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:30,712
to do with getting our data ready for modeling. In this step we might

109
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:34,072
perform some feature engineering and create some new columns. We might fill in

110
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:37,592
some missing values and, and a whole bunch of other data preparation

111
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:41,448
steps, like for example, splitting our data into training and testing.

112
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:45,224
Next we've got my favorite, which is modeling. This is all to do with training

113
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:49,592
your machine learning algorithms to perform well on a specific task.

114
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:53,832
Once we've trained our models in that modeling step, we get onto evaluation.

115
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,632
Given that we've trained our model, we want to make sure that it's going to

116
00:06:56,656 --> 00:07:00,648
work well once we deploy it into the real world. This is what the evaluation

117
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:04,002
step is all about it. In this step, we try to check whether or not

118
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:07,970
our model is likely to perform well using specific evaluation metrics.

119
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,282
Now once we've gone through all of that, the last step is to go and

120
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,594
deploy our model. In order to deploy our model, we could release it as

121
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:18,066
a REST API, containerize it up, or save it as a binary

122
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:21,282
so we can go and use it elsewhere. Now a great

123
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:24,962
way to remember Crisp DM is to remember Barry drove directly to the

124
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,802
Medical Emergency department. That way you remember business Understanding

125
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,682
data understanding data preparation, modeling,

126
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:35,232
evaluation, and deployment. Now I've talked a lot about theory, but where

127
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:39,376
do the Python packages that you typically see used fit into this framework?

128
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:43,232
Well, in terms of data science, Numpy, Pandas, and matplotlib are

129
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:46,704
probably going to be the most important packages that you see floating around.

130
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:50,880
Numpy and Pandas help you traverse and explore your data and really

131
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,184
work with your data in terms of performing manipulations and data preparation.

132
00:07:55,312 --> 00:07:59,200
Matplotlib and Seaborn help you visualize that data and explore it

133
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,074
even further. Now, the most important library in terms of machine learning is probably

134
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:06,242
scikit Learn. So scikit Learn has been around for quite some time

135
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:10,226
and gives you a whole bunch of really powerful algorithms

136
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:13,474
and utilities to help use them to train your machine learning

137
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:16,754
models. Now deep learning is becoming increasingly popular

138
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:20,306
and there's a large number of libraries that can help you perform deep

139
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:24,050
learning. Some of which which are notable are TensorFlow, Keras,

140
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,462
Pytorch, and Theano, just to name a few. And that

141
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:31,398
about wraps up AI vs ML vs DL vs DS.

142
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:34,646
